## üö® Ticket Creation Rules & Best Practices

### Essential Rules
1. **Unused Sections**: If a section isn't needed, put "N/A" and remove bullet points
2. **Be Concise**: Make tickets concise - avoid verbosity, get to the point
3. **Clickable URLs**: All URLs must be formatted as clickable markdown links
4. **Default Sprint**: Add new tickets to "Dragons in refinement" sprint
5. **Clarifying Questions**: Ask clarifying questions for vague requirements before creating
6. **Preview & Approval**: Show ticket preview and get approval before creating in Jira

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] All sections are either filled with relevant content or marked "N/A"
- [ ] Description is concise and clear
- [ ] URLs are properly formatted as `[Link Text](URL)`
- [ ] Requirements are well-defined (no vague statements)

   - [ ] Make content concise and clear
   - [ ] Format all URLs as clickable links `[Text](URL)`
   - [ ] Set Component to "Dragons"
   - [ ] Add "Dragons" label
   - [ ] Set appropriate priority

3. **Get Approval**:
   - [ ] Show complete ticket preview
   - [ ] Get stakeholder approval
   - [ ] Confirm all requirements are clear

### After Creating Ticket
- [ ] Add to "Dragons in refinement" sprint
- [ ] Link to Epic/Parent if applicable
